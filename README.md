# Chicken Disease Image Classification
This end-to-end project showcases the complete life cycle of an AI project that can be used to detect chicken diseases using images of poultry fecal as the basis for its detection. In order to diagnose poultry diseases for small- to medium-scale poultry farmers, images of poultry fecal are used. The images are classified as "Coccidiosis", "Healthy", "New Castle Disease", and "Salmonella".

The Python code is developed in a modular design based on the OOPS principle, and DVC is used for model and data monitoring, as well as versioning. The project has been containerized and deployed to AWS and Azure.
